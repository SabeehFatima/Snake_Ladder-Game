# ðŸŽ² Snake and Ladder Game  

This is my **first C++ gaming project**, developed using **Code::Blocks IDE**. It is a console-based **Snake and Ladder** game that simulates the classic board game experience.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Language:** C++  
- **IDE:** Code::Blocks  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Players roll the dice and move accordingly.  
- Snakes send players backward, while ladders move them forward.  
- Simple console-based UI with automatic turns.  

## ðŸ“œ Game Rules  
1. Each player rolls a dice to move forward.  
2. Landing on a **ladder** moves the player **up**.  
3. Landing on a **snake** moves the player **down**.  
4. The first player to reach the final position **wins**.
